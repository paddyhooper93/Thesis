% This code removes earlier slices affected by artefacts adjacent to
% the vial holder. Usually air pockets diffuse into the first 20 slices.
% It was important to use all available TEs when calculating iMag and R2s
% to generate robust masking later on.

% Calculate R2s and iMag using un-restricted TEs -> for better masking.

    % Note on 7T_BL datasets:
    % At Baseline (tp = 00 mth), the phantom had some residual detergent
    % from washing, making the first 40 slices erroneous.
    % When observing the 7T_BL pipeline, the fieldmapping shows large
    % variability between slices due to chemical shift.
    % Interestingly, the background field correction actually corrects
    % this variability. The 7T_BL dataset looks similar to both
    % the 7T_9mth and 7T_24mth datasets after background field correction.
